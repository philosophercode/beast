bugs:
if all beasts are killed, there is a bug (fixed)
beasts speed up as they are killed (can be good though)
after each round, number of beasts could increase by 2
make beasts H character
make player diamond
fix timing increases to more gradual or same
scaling H and diamond
scaling random grid generator to accommodate for custom columns and rows
organizing code, making it neat and getting rid of unused varibales. If needed for later, just comment the purpose for them

Refactoring:
more dry up down left right consolidation
making grid constructor accept a model grid
beast traversal not by array of possible outcomes
objects instead of arrays when needed for lookups
general function organization.. a more structured initialization and so forth
event listener manager -> good practices that could enfore proper management of listener state
